# eslint-config-chomosuke
This is an opinionated eslint config for typescript based on airbnb-typescript/base

Changes on top of airbnb-typescript/base:
- Indent with 4 spaces instead of 2.
    - According to [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#indentation), if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, youâ€™re screwed anyway, and should fix your program.
- Turned off `linebreak-style: unix`.
    - This really does not matter in any case.
- Turned off `import/prefer-default-export` and replaced it with `import/no-default-export`
    - Naming things are hard enough already, let's only do it once.
    - This also enables auto import in some IDEs
    - People will get confused when they see the same thing with different name in different files
    - `max-lines` will take care of preventing files exporting too many things
- Overridden `no-unused-vars` to allow and enforce leading `_` to indicate intentionally unused args
    - Enforce all unused args to be intentional while allowing unused args to be anywhere.
    - Unused args could make sense when accounting for unimplemented requirements
- Added `@typescript-eslint/member-delimiter-style` to enforce semicolon style.
    - It's good to have consistency.
- Added `eqeqeq`.
    - You almost never want `==`. Even when comparing against `null` it's better to explicitly state if you want to allow `undefined` or not.
- Allowed `ForOfStatement`.
    - Most programmers are more familiar with for loop syntax compared to `forEach()`.
    - Performance shouldn't really be a consideration when using typescript.
- Disallowed type assertion.
    - Type assertion causes the runtime type to be different than the static type. This can cause great confusion especially when the assertion happens much earlier in the execution.
- Turned off `no-use-before-define`.
    - It's preferable to have public interfaces at the top of a module because it allows the reader to see the part they are going to use first. This rule forbids that.
- Added `@typescript-eslint/type-annotation-spacing`.
    - It's good to have consistency.
- Turned off `no-plusplus` & `no-minusminus`.
    - Most programmers are more familiar with for loop syntax compared to `forEach()`.
    - Most programmers are very familiar with `++` & `--` and know most its nuance.
- Added `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`.
    - `any` defeats the purpose of typescript, use `unknown` instead.
    - This should be used with `noImplicitAny` in tsconfig
- Added `max-lines`, `max-statements`, `max-depth` & `complexity`.
    - This is aimed to increase cohesion.
